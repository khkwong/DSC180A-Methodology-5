**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been studying how different machine learning models are capable of emulating existing climate model results

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
One potential investigation we could pursue for Quarter 2 is combining the results of multiple models to create one emulator that may be better than the three emulators individually.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br>
One potential change I'd make to the approach I've taken during my Quarter 1 project is being more responsive to my teamates on Slack in order to keep them updated and be a better teamate.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
I'm interested in using model merging techniques such as bagging and boosting to potentially create a better emulator.
